## First Steps
Start here to understand the core concepts of blockchain, decentralization, and Web3 development. These resources are beginner-friendly and provide a solid foundation to start learning Ethereum. 

- **[Ethereum.org - What is Ethereum?](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)**: [ARTICLE] Official guide to Ethereum, covering blockchain basics principles. The article explains things like What is a blockchain, What can Ethereum do, the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin and more! Definitely the first thing you want to read.
- **[What is Ethereum? A Beginner's Explanation in Plain English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLkbJozKbY)**: [VIDEO] Old but gold, this video starts from Bitcoin to explain how Ethereum was born and expand about Ethereum structure and smart contracts. good for an overview.
- **[Intro on smart contracts](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html)**: [ARTICLE] Intro to smart contracts. That's the solidity documentation website, feel free to go on and read other things on that website like [this example of a simple smart contract](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#a-simple-smart-contract) and [this intro to the Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#index-6)
- **[What is a wallet?](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/)**: [ARTICLE] an overview on what are wallets, and what are they for. Another article from coinbase here
- **[What is Gas in Blockchains?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh8cHUB-KoU)**: [VIDEO] Great visual explaination of the concept of gas and gas fees in the blockchain. 
- **[Blockchain Glossary](https://www.cyfrin.io/glossary)**: [GLOSSARY] If you're unsure about any term used in the blockchain, visit this glossary.
- **[Finematics on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Finematics/videos)**: [YT CHANNEL] This channel explain complex blockchain concepts in a visual and easy way.


## Courses For Beginners
This is a collection of interactive courses to start diving into web3 development.

- **[Cryptozombies - Beginner to Intermediate Smart Contracts](https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity)**: Old but gold! This is a fun and very easy tutorial explaining how to wirte smart contracts. Many great developers started here (Me for example lol)
- **[Blockchain basics by Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics)**: If you want to get really good at smart contract developmnet, this is the first course you want to follow. It starts from the basics and get you tothemooon! Cyfrin gives also certificates of completion after completing a course, so it's great if you're looking for a job.
- **[Ethereum Developer Bootcamp by Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses/ethereum)**: A complete course on blockchain development. Learn to build full stack decentralized applications and get certified by alchemy.
- **[Web2 to Web3 YT series by BuidlGuidl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuJ-elbo88E&list=PLJz1HruEnenAf80uOfDwBPqaliJkjKg69&index=1)**: if you already got experience in web2 this is what you want to follow if you want to learn full stack web3. They start with theory and concepts and they dive into [speedrunethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) challenges.


## Get Your Hands Dirty
The best way to learn things is doing things. Get your hands dirty, NOW!

- **[Speedrunethereum by BuidlGuidl](https://speedrunethereum.com/)**: A set of challenges from [BuildGuidl](https://buidlguidl.com/). Create things like an NFT deployer, staking app, DEX and more complex stuff like a prediction market or over-collateralized lending platform. If you truly go trough all the projects, it means you will be able to build anything you want. In the challenges, they make you use [ScaffoldETH](https://scaffoldeth.io/), a set of tools to kickstart any project on Ethereum.
- **[Ethernaut by OpenZeppelin](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x7E0f53981657345B31C59aC44e9c21631Ce710c7)**: A set of challenges focused on smart contracts. They start easy with things like connect-the-wallet challenge and the more you go on the harder those challenges become, until getting to "hack" a smart contract.


## Advanced Topics
Read/watch these resources if you have a decent understanding of what the blockchain is and if you already experimented with solidity and built some little dapp. 

- **[Blocks In Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/)**: [ARTICLE] In-depth explaination of the concept of block in the Ethereum blockchain
- **[Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcYdEAWch_4)**: [VIDEO] explaination of the 2 most common consensus mechanisms in blockchains. Watch this if you're very interested in knowing how blockchains agree on blocks creation
- **[What's a L2 Blockchain](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-layer-2)**: [ARTICLE] What is a L2 (Layer 2) blockchain explained very well.
- **[Ethereum Rollups (L2 explainer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU)**: [VIDEO] A great visual explaination of rollups (Layer 2 Blockchains).
- **[Intro To Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp)**: [ARTICLE] Introduction to the general concept of zkp (zero knowledge proof). ZKPs are applied to some L2 blockchains to allow them to scale (be faster and cheaper). ZKPs are used in some blockchain protocols like [tornado cash](https://tornado.cash/). It's a bit complex, recommended if .


## Tools
The right tools are essential for Web3 development. Below are the best tools and frameworks for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts and dApps, along with setup guides.
- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)**: Ethereum development environment to build, test and deploy smart contract using Solidity and JS.
- **[Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)**: One of the best and fastest framework to build, test and deploy smart contract using just Solidity. Widely used by professionals ans security researchers.
- **[ScaffoldETH](https://scaffoldeth.io/)**: A complete set of tools to build fully decentralized applications on Ethereum. Great for experimenting and learning Web3 full stack development


## Dapps
The best way to understand Ethereum and the blockchain is to be a user. Play with these 7 wallets/dapps/protocols to practice a little bit how to interact with the blockchain and what kind of applications are built on ethereum

1. **Before going on, you need a wallet dude**. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is the most common wallet. Other amazing wallets are [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) or [Phantom](https://phantom.com/).
2. **Buy some cryptocurrency before starting**. [Base App](https://www.coinbase.com/it/wallet) (previously Coinbase Wallet) is a wallet that allow you to buy cryptocurrencies and have a smooth onboarding. Others are [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/it) and you can also use [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto)
3. **Swap baby!** [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap) is a decentralized exchange allowing you to swap cryptocurrencies using liquidity pools. uniswap have different versions, you can choose which to use. You can also put there liquidity and earn fees on other people's swaps.
4. **Buy NFT and call your lambo dealer**. [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) is the biggest NFT marketplace on earth. buy some NFT and watch their price go up to the moon or down to the hell. Good for experimenting about how NFT buy/sell/royalty work.
5. **Get a unique Ethereum handle**. [ENS](https://opensea.io/) (Ethereum Name Service) allow you to buy a name and tie it to an ethereum address. This way other users can send you tokens just using your handle.
6. **Lend and borrow money... without a bank**. [Aave](https://aave.com/) is a lending protocol. You can put liquidity and earn fees or borrow tokens by giving other tokens as a deposit.
7. **Make some bet on any event in the future**. [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) allow you to bet on possible outcomes of real world events. For instance: [Will Elon register the America Party by...?](https://polymarket.com/event/will-elon-register-the-america-party-by?tid=1753105753082)
8. **Subscribe to a decentralized social network and join the web3 community**. Go to [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz/) and make your decentralized social network profile.
