## First Steps - Resources
New to Web3? Start here to understand the core concepts of blockchain, decentralization, and Web3 development. These resources are beginner-friendly and provide a solid foundation. 

- **[Ethereum.org - What is Ethereum?](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)**: [ARTICLE] Official guide to Ethereum, covering blockchain basics principles. The article explains:
	- What is a blockchain
  - What can Ethereum do
  - What is a cryptocurrency
  - Why using Ethereum and Who runs it
  - What are smart contracts
  - What is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin
  - and more!
- **[What is Ethereum? A Beginner's Explanation in Plain English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLkbJozKbY)**: [VIDEO] Old but gold, this video starts from Bitcoin to explain how Ethereum was born and expand about Ethereum structure and smart contracts. good for an overview.
- **[Intro on smart contracts]([https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html))**: [ARTICLE] Intro to smart contracts. That's the solidity documentation website, feel free to go on and read other things on that website like [this example of a simple smart contract](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#a-simple-smart-contract) and [this intro to the Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#index-6)
- **[What is a wallet?](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/)**: [Article] an overview on what are wallets, and what are they for. Another article from coinbase here
- **[Blockchain Glossary](https://www.cyfrin.io/glossary)**: If you're unsure about any term used in the blockchain, visit this glossary.


## Recommended courses to move your first steps in blockchain development 
- **[Cryptozombies - Beginner to Intermediate Smart Contracts](https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity)**: Old but gold! This is a fun and very easy tutorial explaining how to wirte smart contracts. Many great developers started here (Me for example lol)
- **[Blockchain basics by Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics)**: If you want to get really good at smart contract developmnet, this is the first course you want to follow. It starts from the basics and get you tothemooon! Cyfrin gives also certificates of completion after completing a course, so it's great if you're looking for a job.


## Put in practice your skills
- **[Speedrunethereum by BuidlGuidl](https://speedrunethereum.com/)**: A set of challenges from [BuildGuidl](https://buidlguidl.com/). Start easy by creating simple projects






## Intermediate
- **[Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcYdEAWch_4)**:
what is L2

**Why These?** These resources bridge the gap between basics and advanced topics, teaching practical skills like deploying NFT contracts or integrating dApps with frontends like React.

## Advanced
For experienced developers, these resources dive into complex Web3 topics like cross-chain interoperability, layer 2 solutions, and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Getting Hands Dirty
Experiment with smart contracts and dApps on these platforms to gain practical experience and build real projects.


## Tools
The right tools are essential for Web3 development. Below are the best tools and frameworks for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts and dApps, along with setup guides.


## Dapps


**Why These?** These platforms offer interactive, hands-on environments to practice coding, deploy contracts, and build portfolio-worthy dApps. Start with Ethernaut for security or Metaschool for guided projects.
